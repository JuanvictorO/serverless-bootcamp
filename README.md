# Serverless Framework Bootcamp
It's a serverless framework bootcamp using AWS and Node.js technologies and 3 different microservices (Auction Service, Auth Service and Notification Service).

You can access each folder to see more informations about de microservices and how to deploy/test them.

It's a project made with an Udemy course called [Serverless Framework Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/serverless-framework) by [Ariel Weinberger](https://www.udemy.com/course/serverless-framework/?couponCode=PPINTENTP3#instructor-1) and I truly recommend his udemy courses.
